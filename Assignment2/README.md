# Real Time Reddit Post Classification

# <h2> Summary: </h2> Real-time classification of sub-reddit 'Politics' posts into Democratic vs Republican. Employs Reddit-API, and pre-trained PCA and ML models. Requires login credentials and secret key to run.

For my Natural Language Processing class, I created a real-time reddit post classification model that classified sub-reddit "politics" posts into Democrat vs Republican using pre-trained PCA and Machine Learning models. Please note that you need a username and password, and a client_id and client_secret
to run this model. I used the Reddit-API to obtain the data.
